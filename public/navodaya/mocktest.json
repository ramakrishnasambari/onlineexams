Sometimes a volcano may remain quiet for centuries and then suddenly become active. This is called a ‘volcanic eruption’, and great clouds of ash, dust, gas and steam rise from the crater accompanied by a loud noise. After sometime, hot molten rock, called lava, begins to flow down the mountain. This may continue for many days or weeks. Then the volcano will ‘go to sleep’ again, or remain ‘dormant’ for many years. Most volcanoes are found near the sea, leading to formation of islands.",
